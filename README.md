# System-Dice
A dice rolling app designed for a custom tabletop role playing game. 
Personal project not intended for a large-scale release. Counts the dice in ways specific ways to increase functionality for the role playing game. Has five main activities: main roll, position roll, attack roll, defense roll and misc. roll (last function is not yet complete but unnecessary for core game play). This is my first major android studio project.
